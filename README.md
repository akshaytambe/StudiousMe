## Database Design:
The general theme behind a database is to handle information as an integrated whole. A database is a collection of interrelated data stored with minimum redundancy to serve many users quickly and effectively. After designing input and output, the analyst must concentrate on database design or how data should be organized around user requirements. The general objective is to make information access, easy quick, inexpensive and flexible for other users. During database design the following objectives are concerned:-
- Controlled Redundancy
- Data independence
- Accurate and integrating
- More information at low cost
- Recovery from failure
- Privacy and security
- Performance
- Ease of learning and use

## Benefits by using this Website:
- User friendly interface

- Less error
- More Storage Capacity
- Search facility
- Look and Feel Environment
- Quick transaction
- EXTRA feature of Study Resources
- E-Receipt Facility

## Extensibility: 
This system is extendable in ways that its original developers may not expect. The following principle enhances extensibility like hide data structure, avoid traversing multiple links or methods, avoid case statements on object type and distinguish public and private operations. 

## Reusability: 
Reusability is possible as and when require in this website. We can update it next version. Reusable software reduces design, coding and testing cost by amortizing effort over several designs. Reducing the amount of code also simplifies understanding, which increases the likelihood that the code is correct. We follow up both types of reusability: Sharing of newly written code within a project and reuse of previously written code on new projects.
